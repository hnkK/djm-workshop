# DJM - Workshop

<p>A Home page realised for DJM Digital during a interview process</p>

<p>A .psd prototype was included in the folder project, showing a desktop template. The responsive was not required.</p>

<p>Free to use technologies and tools, I have decided to made it with vanilla HTML - SCSS (The job involved a lot of integration, I found revelant to show my HTML/CSS knowledges in priority). Due to tight deadlines, I choose to focus on the desktop version </p>

<p>The code could be improved but it met the recruiter expectations</p>
